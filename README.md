### Usage

##### Don't forget to change meta tags!
You can change the meta tags in the `next.config.js` file:
- Update `WEBSITE_URI` with the base path of your project. This will be used for link sharing and OG image.
- Update `WEBSITE_NAME` and `WEBSITE_TITLE` with your project name
- Update `WEBSITE_DESCRIPTION` with your project description
- Update `PROJECT_GITHUB_URL` with your project GitHub link

Then, you can go in `pages/_app.tsx` and update some more info: 
- Update the content of the meta `theme-color` with your primary color
- Update `og.jpeg` by the OG image name in the `public` folder
- Update twitter handle if required

Then, you can update the `public/manifest.json` file which will be use for the Gnosis wallet support:
- Update `name` with your project name
- Update `description` with your project description
- Update `iconPath` with the relative path to your SVG icon (ideally, it should stay as is)
